## Introduction
This repository serves as a collection of C-based projects developed for learning, practice, and real-world applications. Each project is designed to demonstrate key C programming concepts, including:
- Low-level memory management
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- System calls and POSIX Threads (pthreads)
- Networking and socket programming
- File handling and process management

## Projects
### 1. Data Structures and Algorithms
This section includes implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms in C, such as:
- Sorting algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Searching algorithms (Binary Search, DFS, BFS)
- Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, and Graphs

### 2. System Programming
Projects related to operating systems, multi-threading, and process management:
- **Process Scheduler**: A simple CPU scheduling simulator.
- **Multi-threaded Matrix Multiplication**: Using pthreads for parallel computation.
- **File System Explorer**: A CLI tool to navigate directories and files.

### 3. Networking
Networking-based projects utilizing sockets and communication protocols:
- **Chat Application**: A basic client-server chat program using TCP/IP.
- **HTTP Server**: A simple web server handling HTTP requests.
- **Network Packet Sniffer**: Capturing and analyzing network packets.

### 4. Utilities and Tools
Small tools and utilities for everyday use:
- **File Compressor**: A Huffman coding-based compression tool.
- **Memory Debugger**: A tool to detect memory leaks and buffer overflows.
- **CLI Task Manager**: A command-line utility for monitoring running processes.

## Installation
To get started with these projects, clone the repository and navigate to the desired project folder:


git clone https://github.com/AngelosKontalis/C-projects.git
cd C-projects/<project-folder>


Ensure you have a C compiler installed (GCC or Clang recommended). Some projects may require additional libraries, which will be listed in their respective directories.

## Usage
Each project contains a `README.md` file with specific instructions on how to compile and run the code. Generally, you can compile and run a C program with:


gcc -o program program.c -Wall -Wextra
./program


For multi-file projects with Makefiles:

make
./program
